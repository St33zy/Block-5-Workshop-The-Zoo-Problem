        <ol>
          <li>Frankie</li>
            <p>
                Meet Frankie the giraffe, a lanky fellow with a neck so long that it's practically a GPS antenna for clouds. <br>His spots are like a modern art masterpiece, a chaotic blend of polka dots gone wild. <br>Frankie's eyes, big and bug-eyed, perpetually look surprised, as if he just heard the world's longest joke and is still waiting for the punchline.
            </p>
          <li>Coconut</li>
            <p>

         <ol>
           <li>Mella</li>
             <p>
                Mella the lion, with a majestic golden mane that could rival a rockstar's hairstyle, struts around the savannah like it's her personal runway. <br>Her roar sounds more like a vocal warm-up for a Broadway musical, complete with dramatic pauses that keep the audience—aka the other animals—on the edge of their bushes.
             </p>
           <li>Karl</li>
             <p>
                Karl the lion is not your typical king of the jungle; he's more like the monarch of the nap.<br> His luxurious mane is a tangled masterpiece that looks like he just stepped out of a wind tunnel.<br> Karl's roars are more like sleepy yawns, as if he's trying to wake up but can't resist hitting the snooze button on his majestic voice.

          <li>Cookie</li>
            <p>
                Cookie the monkey is a furry ball of mischief with a penchant for banana peels and a grin that could outshine a Cheshire cat.<br> Her fur is a wild explosion of brown and gold that makes her look like she just stepped out of a tie-dye salon for primates.<br> Cookie's eyes sparkle with the mischievous glint of a monkey who's plotting the next great banana heist.
            </p>
          <li>Earl</li>
            <p>
                Earl the monkey is the jungle's answer to slapstick comedy.<br> His fur, a chaotic mix of brown and beige, looks like it had a wild night out with a static electricity generator.<br> Earl's eyes have a perpetual look of surprise, as if he just discovered that bananas are, in fact, not tree ornaments.
            </p>
          <li>Banana Pudding</li>
            <p>
                Banana Pudding the monkey is a walking, talking (well, sort of), banana-loving comedy show.<br> Her fur is a riotous mix of sunshine yellow and cream, making her look like a tropical dessert gone rogue.<br> Banana Pudding's eyes gleam with mischievous delight, especially when she's orchestrating elaborate banana pranks on her fellow jungle residents.

          <li>Wren</li>
            <p>
                Wren the alligator is the ultimate reptilian stand-up comedian in the swamp.<br> Sporting a toothy grin that seems more mischievous than menacing, Wren's scales shimmer with a green hue that looks like it was painted by a colorblind artist.<br> His eyes, usually half-lidded, give off an air of perpetual nonchalance, as if he's mastered the art of the casual swamp saunter.
            </p>
          <li>Aspen</li>
            <p>
                Aspen the alligator is the hipster of the swamp, sporting a set of scales that look like they've been individually hand-painted in trendy pastel shades.<br> His toothy grin is less about intimidation and more about showcasing his commitment to a sustainable, organic lifestyle in the swamp.

          <li>Mika</li>
